### Pull Requests

Follow these steps for a successful pull request (PR):

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Install the project** and run all tests to ensure your environment is set up correctly.
3. **Make your changes**. Write detailed commit messages and keep your PR as small and focused as possible. Include tests that cover the new functionality or fix the issue.
4. **Run the tests** again to ensure everything still passes, including your new tests.
5. **Submit your PR** with a detailed description of your changes. Link any relevant issues.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Code style**: Follow the existing code style. Use comments and adhere to best practices.
- **Documentation**: Update the README.md or documentation if necessary. Your code should be well-documented.
